<!-- Asynchronous JavaScript
    Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a
     potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other 
     events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has 
     finished. Once that task has finished, your program is presented with the result

Synchronous vs Asynchronous Javascript?

Javascript is the synchronous single-threaded language but with the help of 
event-loop and promises, JavaScript is used to do asynchronous programming.

Javascript is a single-threaded language, meaning that just one line of code may be 
run at once. Javascript is single-threaded because, originally, it was only a web 
browser scripting language created to serve the needs of a single user on a single window of the browser, eliminating the need for multithreading.


 Ajax  
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of 
the XMLHttpRequest object to communicate with servers. It can send and receive 
information in various formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and text files.
