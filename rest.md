Ajax 




AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of 
the XMLHttpRequest object to communicate with servers. It can send and receive 
information in various formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and text files.

AJAX is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages. AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes
