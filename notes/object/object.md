JavaScript Objects are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript. The “Object” class represents the JavaScript data types. Objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined, and symbol). It is used to store different types of key collections and complex entities. It can be created by using the Object() method or by using object initializer/literal syntax.
: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a text-based, human-readable interchange format used for representing simple data structures and objects in web browser-based code. JavaScript objects can only exist within the JavaScript language, so when you are working with data that needs to be accessed by various languages, it is best to refer to JSON.

rules
The object is always defined inside the curly brackets { }.
Objects are written in key pairs.
The keys must be strings, and their values must be a valid JSON data type. The JSON data types can be number, string, object, boolean, array, or null.
The keys and values are separated by a colon(“:”).
Each key or value pair is separated by a comma.
