//    Question 1 Print 1 to 10 using ++ operator
let a = 1
console.log(a++,a++,a++,a++,a++,a++,a++,a++,a++,a++,);

//Question 2 Print 10 to 1 using -- operator
let b = 10
console.log(b--,b--,b--,b--,b--,b--,b--,b--,b--,b--);

// Question 3 Check output of following in console

console.log(1+1)
console.log(1+200);
console.log(200+"300" + 200 )
console.log("learnjavascript" + 400);

//Question 4 Check result of following

console.log(2 === 2)                          //  true   *comparison operator (value and type check)
console.log(2 == "2")                         //  true  *comparison operator (value)
console.log(2 === +"2")                       //  true   + this symbol string change to number 
console.log("learnjavascript" == "learnjavascript")   // true 
console.log("LearnJavascript" == "learnjavascript")   // false javaScript case senctive
console.log(0.3 == 0.30)                      // true
console.log(1.0 == 1)                         // true 
console.log(1.0 === 1)                        // true 


// Question 5 - Create 5 variables for your bank account details. It would be better if you use let, const and var all 3
let name = "aarif mohammad"
const account_number  = 134567876543
const IFCE_CODE = "ucbo1234"
var statment = 1111
var amount = 2222

// Question 6- Write any code and explain that code using multi line comment
/* let hii = "hello"
const what_are_you_doing = "nothing"
let and_you = "wreeting a program" */

// Question 7 Write difference between Process and Thread

   process = "When a program is under execution, then it is known as a process ",
  "If one process is obstructed then it will not affect the operation of another process."
  thread = "A segment of a process is known as thread.",
  "If one thread is obstructed then it will affect the execution of another process."


  // Question 8- Write differences between let, const and var
  
  /*
  var -  re-declared and updated  ,Hoisting of var(undifind) ,var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.
  let -  let can be updated but not re-declared.,let is block scoped ,Hoisting of var(error)

  const - const cannot be updated or re-declared

  -- * While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.
*/

//Question 9 Give 1 example of each operator with expected output:

console.log(2**3);   // 8 Exponentiation (power)
console.log(10%3);   // 1 Remainder
console.log(2!=3);   // true  (notequel value)
console.log(2!=="2");   // true notequel value and data type
console.log(2<=3);      // true (2 less then 3 or 2 equel 3)
console.log(2>=3);      // false (2 greter ten 3 or 2eque 3)

// Question 10- Write in your own language. What is JavaScript? Explain in detail.
